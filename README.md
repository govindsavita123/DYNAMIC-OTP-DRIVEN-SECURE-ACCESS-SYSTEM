# DYNAMIC-OTP-DRIVEN-SECURE-ACCESS-SYSTEM
Secure access control using GSM-based dynamic OTP verification and real-time validation.
This project implements a microcontroller-based time-limited authentication system where a password-protected interface sends a dynamically generated OTP via GSM, which must be entered within a limited timeframe to grant access.
🧠 Project Objective
To design and develop an OTP-based time-restricted access control system using GSM technology with LPC2148 microcontroller, ensuring enhanced security for restricted access environments.

🧩 System Overview
flowchart TD
    A[User Enters Static Password] --> B{Is Password Correct?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Generate OTP via RTC]
    C --> D[Send OTP to Registered Mobile via GSM]
    D --> E[User Enters OTP]
    E --> F{Is OTP Correct & Timely?}
    F -- Yes --> G[Access Granted: Activate Motor/Door]
    F -- No --> H[Access Denied: Reset to Initial State]
    B -- No --> I[Access Denied: Retry]

    🛠️ Hardware Requirements
🧠 LPC2148 Microcontroller

📡 GSM Module (M660A)

🖥️ 16x2 LCD Display

🎛️ 4x4 Matrix Keypad

🔘 Switch

💾 EEPROM (AT24C256)

🔄 Core Workflow
System prompts for a secure static password via keypad.

If correct, the system:

Generates an OTP using RTC.

Sends OTP to a registered mobile via GSM module.

User must enter OTP within limited time.

On successful verification:

Access is granted (e.g., motor turns ON).

If OTP is invalid or delayed:

Access is denied, and system resets.

💬 GSM AT Commands Used
txt
Copy code
AT            // Check GSM connection
ATE0          // Turn off echo
AT+CMGF=1     // Set text mode
AT+CMGS="MOBILE_NO" // Send message
Use CTRL+Z after typing the message to send OTP via HyperTerminal during testing.

 Password & OTP Flow
Static password is stored in EEPROM.

OTP is generated after static password validation.

OTP expiry is checked using RTC module.

All incorrect attempts or timeout reset the system.

🧪 Testing Strategy
Each module should be tested individually:

✅ LCD display (char, string, integer)

✅ Keypad input display

✅ EEPROM read/write

✅ UART transmission with interrupt

✅ External interrupt with LED

✅ GSM module AT command response

✅ RTC time readout

✅ Final integration with projectmain.c
